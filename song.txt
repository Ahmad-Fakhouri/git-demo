Take my hand
Never let go
Even one soft sound can shake the hardest ground
And even if we die striving to find the peace we lost

Rase your voice, light the fire
'Til our hopes and fears reach a billion ears

[EMILY, CHARLIE, HUSK & NIFFTY]
Lend your breath, join the choir
Let the music span o'er this broken land

[EMILY, CHARLIE, HUSK, NIFFTY & VAGGIE]
And many years from now, if any live to hear this song
